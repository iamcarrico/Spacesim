#Hello

This is a very, very rough draft. More of an excuse to learn more than a serious attempt at something. 

Fans of the Escape Velocity series should feel somewhat at home.

#Requirements
* ezSQL (Thanks to @justinvincent) (included)
* jQuery
* Javascript must be enabled

#Install
Good luck. Should be easy though: import the included sql file and update config.php

#Testing
A testing account is included in the .sql file.
The username is testing the password is testing. Imaginative, I know.
