#Hello

This is a very, very rough draft. More of an excuse to learn more than a serious attempt at something. 

Fans of the Escape Velocity series should feel somewhat at home.

#Requirements
* ezSQL (Thanks to @justinvincent) (included)
* jQuery
* Javascript must be enabled

#Install
Good luck. Should be easy though: import the included sql file and update config.php

#Testing
A testing account is included in the .sql file.
The username is "testing" and the password is "testing"

#Caveats
This code is in no way secure and should be treated as such.
